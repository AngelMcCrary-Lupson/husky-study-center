# Husky Study Center
An Agora powered web video call app

## Project Inspiration
When classes were still in person and college campus was open, I spent a majority of my time
in study centers and libraries. I found solace in surrounding myself with individuals who were
working just as hard as me for their education and in the case of major department study centers,
I would interact with peers to give and receive help while studying. With Husky Study Center,
I wanted to capture this experience virtually.
